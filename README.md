## Introduction

Probability distributions play a crucial role in machine learning and statistics. This repository is dedicated to exploring and analyzing probability distributions, with a focus on the Bernoulli and Poisson distributions. These distributions are fundamental in many machine learning algorithms and statistical modeling tasks.

## Contents

- **`mle_bernoulli_parameter.py`**: Python script for calculating the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) for the Bernoulli parameter.
- **`poisson_probability.py`**: Python script for computing probabilities using the Poisson distribution.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abelxmendoza/Probability-Distributions-Analysis-MachineLearning.git
```


Please refer to the individual script files for more information on how to use them.

## Usage

* Use `mle_bernoulli_parameter.py` to calculate the MLE for the Bernoulli parameter based on your binary dataset.
* Use `poisson_probability.py` to calculate probabilities using the Poisson distribution, given the appropriate parameters.
